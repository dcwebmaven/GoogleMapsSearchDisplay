# GoogleMapsSearchDisplay
This AJAX project uses Google Maps API and displays the map only after a name is searched. Also includes customized controls for map display.

The objective/specs for this project were as follows:

Create an HTML document that uses AJAX and an XML document. 
Add code to the HTML document to make it so the map is not displayed initially. 
It will only be displayed after a search is performed.

Customize the controls on your map. You could add street view, make the map options a drop-down list. 
Explore the documentation for some of the possibilities.
